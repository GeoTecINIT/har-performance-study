# Significance results

Manually obtained results from Mann-Withney U and Kruskal-Wallis H statistical tests generated in the `./2_data-sources.ipynb` and `./3_models.ipynb` notebooks. These results are the following:

- `best_sources.csv`: indicates, for each model and amount of training data, how many data sources were statistically the best (0 - No differences, 1 - One data source provided the best results, 2 - Two data sources provided non-statistically different results).
- `best_models.csv`: indicates, for each data source and amount of training data, how many models were statistically the best (0 - No differences, 1 - One model provided the best results, 2 - Two models provided non-statistically different results, 3 - Three models provided non-statistically different results)
